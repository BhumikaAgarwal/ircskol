                    The Indian Red Cross is a voluntary humanitarian organization having a network of over 1200 branches
                    throughout the country, providing relief in times of disasters/emergencies and promotes health &
                    care of
                    the vulnerable people and communities. It is a leading member of the largest independent
                    humanitarian
                    organization in the world, the International Red Cross & Red Crescent Movement. The movement has
                    three
                    main components, the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC), National Societies and
                    International
                    Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

                    <p> The Mission of the Indian Red Cross is to inspire, encourage and initiate at all times all forms
                        of
                        humanitarian activities so that human suffering can be minimized and even prevented and thus
                        contribute
                        to creating more congenial climate for peace.History of Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement
                        Young Swiss businessman, Jean Henry Dunant was appalled by the condition of the wounded soldiers
                        he happened to see in the battle field of Solferino , Italy in 1859 during the Franco - Austrian
                        war. He arranged relief services with the help of the local community immediately. He wrote the
                        book 'Memory of Solferino' suggesting that a neutral organization be established to aid the
                        wounded soldiers in times of war. Just a year after the release of this book, an international
                        conference was convened in Geneva to consider the suggestions of Henry Dunant and thus the Red
                        Cross Movement was born. International Red Cross Movement was established by Geneva Convention
                        of 1864. The name and the emblem of the movement are derived from the reversal of the Swiss
                        national flag, to honor the country in which Red Cross was found.

                        Origin of Indian Red Cross Society
                        During the first world war in 1914, India had no organization for relief services to the
                        affected soldiers, except a branch of the St. John Ambulance Association and by a Joint
                        Committee of the British Red Cross. Later, a branch of the same Committee was started to
                        undertake the much needed relief services in collaboration with the St. John Ambulance
                        Association in aid of the soldiers as well as civilian sufferers of the horrors of that great
                        war. A bill to constitute the Indian Red Cross Society, Independent of the British Red Cross,
                        was introduced in the Indian Legislative Council on 3rd March 1920 by Sir Claude Hill, member of
                        the Viceroy's Executive Council who was also Chairman of the Joint war Committee in India . The
                        Bill was passed on 17th March 1920 and became Act XV of 1920 with the assent of the Governor
                        General on the 20th March 1920 .

                        On 7th June 1920 , fifty members were formally nominated to constitute the Indian Red Cross
                        Society and the first Managing Body was elected from among them with Sir Malcolm Hailey as
                        Chairman.

                        Indian Red Cross Society is a member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
                        Crescent Movement. Relations between the IRCS and the India Delegation of the Federation are
                        strong.

                        Indian Red Cross Society has partnership with National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies,
                        St.John Ambulance, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IFRC),
                        International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC ), Multinational firms. Individuals and others in
